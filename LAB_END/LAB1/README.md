### Lab Experiment Question - 1

Title: Create a NodeJS script to read and write data to a file.

Objective: To develop a Node.js script that allows users to perform file operations (read, write, and append) using the readline module and fs (File System) module.

Question: Write a Node.js program that performs file operations based on user input. The program should:

1.  Allow the user to read the contents of a file.
2.  Allow the user to write new content to a file, replacing existing content.
3.  Allow the user to append new content to an existing file.
4.  Continue prompting the user for operations until they choose to exit.

Implement the above functionality using the switch statement and readline module. Demonstrate the execution of your script by performing all three file operations in sequence.

Expected Output:

- If the file exists, the read operation should display its contents.
- The write operation should replace the fileâ€™s contents.
- The append operation should add new content without removing existing data.
